# Persistent Memory — Instructions

This file is auto-loaded into every session via `@.claude/memory/INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
Read and follow these rules without being asked.

## When to save (do not wait to be asked)

Save a memory **only** when a future session would benefit from knowing this **before trying to discover it alone**.
Hard-won knowledge only — obvious things, summaries, and temporary context do not qualify.

| Learned... | Memory type |
|------------|-------------|
| Model kept repeating a mistake until corrected by the user | `feedback` |
| Architecture or pattern discovered after failures or many attempts | `architecture` |
| Business rule that affects code and is not obvious from reading the repo | `business-rule` |
| Where external info lives (Linear, Grafana, Slack, dashboards, wikis) | `reference` |

**Do NOT save:**
- Things derivable by reading the code or git history
- Deadlines, motivations, or temporary project context
- Debug steps or fix recipes (those belong in the commit message)
- Anything already documented in CLAUDE.md files

**Quality test before saving:** Would a future Claude session working on this codebase be surprised
and grateful to know this before starting? If not, skip it.

## How to save

1. Write a `.md` file in `.claude/memory/` with this frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: kebab-case-slug
description: one-line summary — used to decide relevance in future sessions
metadata:
  type: feedback | architecture | business-rule | reference
---

Fact or rule. **Why:** the reason this matters or was hard to discover. **How to apply:** when and where this applies.
```

2. Add one line to `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` (the index):
   `- [Title](filename.md) — one-line hook describing what this memory is for`

## Sanitation (mandatory when index is large)

Before writing a new memory entry, count the non-blank lines in `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`.
If ≥ 130 lines, run sanitation first:

1. Read all memory files in `.claude/memory/`
2. Score each entry: **recency × specificity × likelihood of preventing a real future mistake**
3. Move low-score files to `.claude/memory/archive/` (never delete outright)
4. Rewrite the `MEMORY.md` index keeping only the remaining files (target: ≤ 130 lines)
5. Then write the new memory

## Reading memories

Before acting on any complex request: scan `MEMORY.md` for entries relevant to the current task.
Load and apply the relevant memory files before responding — do not rely solely on the index summary.
